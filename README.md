# Projekt 2: www.manducare.ch :yum:

This project for the final exam of CAS Frontend Engineering at the Hochschule in Rapperswil was implemented by
Tanja Sennhauser and Andr√© Ceres. The web application is optimized for Chrome, Safari, IE Edge and Mobile Browser.

## CLI tool for Angular

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.2.0.

The Angular CLI makes it easy to create an application that already works, right out of the box.

###

## Installation for local use and development

:exclamation: Note: Make sure that you are connected with Internet. You also need [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) on your machine installed.

### Clone the repository from the GitHub

`
git clone https://github.com/aceres/cas-fee-project2-af
`

### Switch the directory for starting the web application

`
cd cas-fee-project2-af
`

### Run the web application

`
npm run start
`

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Demo (Login)

## Development

### Run the unit tests

`
npm run test
`

## Development server (Address Information)

Firebase (Real Database and Hosting)

`
https://console.firebase.google.com/project/project2-60db1/overview
`

Web App on Development Modus

`
https://project2-60db1.firebaseapp.com/public
`

## Production server (Address Information)

Firebase (Real Database and Hosting)

`
https://console.firebase.google.com/project/manducare-v1/overview
`

Web App on Production Modus

`
https://manducare-v1.firebaseapp.com/public
`

or

`
http://www.manducare.ch
`

## Build it for the development modus on firebase host

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Build it for the production modus on firebase host

Run `ng build -prod --aot=false` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. 

Note: 

After running this command: `ng build -prod --aot=false` the environment setting will not be oriented for the production. :flushed:

Therefore we need to change the setting manually for deploying with correct setting to the production host:

`
/src/environment/environment.ts
`

Use this configuration for the file above manually:

```
export const environment = {
  production: true,
  firebase: {
    apiKey: 'AIzaSyBfCNtrWk37h4lqm28Toes6e5efVY1eJyQ',
    authDomain: 'manducare-v1.firebaseapp.com',
    databaseURL: 'https://manducare-v1.firebaseio.com',
    projectId: 'manducare-v1',
    storageBucket: 'manducare-v1.appspot.com',
    messagingSenderId: '391938033267'
  },
  apiUrl: 'https://manducare-v1.firebaseio.com/'
};
```

and run this before to deploy on the firebase production host:

`ng build -prod --aot=false`

:thumbsup:

Problem: Switching to prod with `ng build --prod`
